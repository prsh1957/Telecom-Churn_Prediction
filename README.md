# Telecom-Churn_Prediction (PYTHON and R)

Project Background: In telecommunications industry, customers are able to easily switch between different service providers and it costs company 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain the existing customers. Hence controlling churn has gained a lot of importance in the industry.

Objective: The goal is to determine the ability of different factors such as minutes of usage, revenue from the customer, duration of customer etc. to drive the behaviour of churn which can be used by the company in their proactive retention programmes. 

Granularity: This study examines customer churn at the individual account level.

Scope: To build a different analytical models for predicting churn as a dependent variable with independent variables like average minutes of usage, average revenue etc. to determine which factors are significant in prediction of the churn.  

The focus of the models was on reducing ‘Type I error’ (or increasing sensitivity),  as the objective of this study is to help the retention programmes of the service provider by predicting churn.

Analysed 66000 customers with 70+ predictor variables
